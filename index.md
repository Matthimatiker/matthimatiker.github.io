## About Me ##

Hi there, my name is Matthias. I am a passionate software developer and Head of an Imaginary Software Architecture Advisory Board (HISAAB).

Check out my GitHub profile (@Matthimatiker) to find out more about my current side projects.

I enjoy funny puns. And the not so funny ones, too.
