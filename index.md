## About Me ##

Hi there, my name is Matthias. I am a passionate software developer and I am working as a freelance web developer.  
I focus on (but I am not limited to) web projects with PHP/Symfony. I rely heavily on Test Driven Development, Pair Programming and team collaboration.

Check out my GitHub profile (@Matthimatiker) if you want to find out more about my current side projects.

Personal information: I enjoy funny puns. And the not so funny ones, too.
